# RMIInAction
RMI very basic sample to use RMI as a starting point.

As we dont use packages in this example, we can do in terminal, after found path to: "ServerMain.class" (in target folder)

cd..... (what the heck)
java ServerMain

Using packages:

If You for example used:
package it.polimi;

1) open a Terminal where "classes" is (inside "target")
2) ls will show NO item, but is fine
3) execute: java it/polimi/ClientMain
